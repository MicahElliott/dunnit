# INSTRUCTIONS: Creating a good summary

Each `> IMPACT(N)` line will stand out as a key takeaway for a
section. You can create multiple impacts. They also roll into your
weekly report. Replace the `N` with a number between 1-5, 1 being no
impact, 5 being great impact.

You can merge your bullets into fewer; probably ~5 is a good max
number of call-out bullets.

Your _Productivity Score_ will roll into the weekly report. Make it a
1-5 score, 1 being a worthless day, 5 being incredible.

Keep the format as-is. The report/slideshow depend on the structure.
