Dear Friend,

I’m hoping you’d be interested in trying out a simple new productivity
tool I’ve been working on. It’s called Dunnit (for now), and it helps
you capture your day’s progress.

If you’re willing to give it a spin, just follow the instructions on
this page: https://github.com/micahelliott/dunnit. It runs only on a
Mac desktop and is most suited for those of you who are at a computer
most of the work day.

I’d greatly appreciate you emailing me if you find some time to give
it a try. Or, you can even fill out a survey
[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeg7IHRBzcAVq5PFDBwY06Jp97ziEF50eUqz-NDIFFw5seVLg/viewform)
– it’s the most useful way for me to determine if I should spend a
bunch more time turning Dunnit into a real app.

Hope you’re doing well and would love to hear from you!
– Micah
