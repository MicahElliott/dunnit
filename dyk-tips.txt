If you hold the mouse on a popup, it won’t disappear.
You can put any tag in a Dunnit to categorize it.
Popups are expandable (and sometimes scrollable); try looking at the top and bottom of this message with your mouse! You’ll often want to do this when GOALs and TODOs are listed.
You can set your preferences for things like standup time and day start and end.
Dunnit is a proof-of-concept. A more capable version is in the works.
